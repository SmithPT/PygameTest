#SNAKE TO DO
1) Create start screen
    - Require any key to skip a background/start screen for snake to start moving
2) Create end screen
3) Restart button
    - Should be easy to bind a reset to r_down
4) Collision with itself
    - Might have to save snake position in a vector and update as it moves to have it collide with old positions
    - Google smarter method you idiot
5) Better sprite
    - Doesn't leave tongue as it moves
6) Music?
    - No?
7) Add item to collect
    - Longterm
8) Win screen
    - Good joke
